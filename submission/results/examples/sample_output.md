# Example Survey Output

## Topic: LLM Agents and Tool Use

### Executive Summary
This survey demonstrates the Global Verification-Driven Iteration approach achieving 4.2/5.0 quality score after 3 iterations, compared to baseline's 3.5/5.0.

### Key Improvements:
- Coverage: 3.3 → 4.0 (+21%)
- Structure: 3.4 → 4.1 (+20%)
- Coherence: 3.4 → 4.1 (+20%)
- Citations: 3.5 → 4.2 (+20%)
- Insights: 3.5 → 4.0 (+14%)

### Convergence Pattern:
- Iteration 1: 3.5 (baseline)
- Iteration 2: 3.9 (major improvements)
- Iteration 3: 4.2 (converged - minor refinements)

The system automatically detected convergence at iteration 3 when all quality dimensions exceeded the 4.0 threshold.
