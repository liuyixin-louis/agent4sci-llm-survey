\section{AI Contribution Statement}

This paper represents a collaborative effort between an AI system (Claude Sonnet 4) and human researchers, with the AI serving as the primary author. The AI system was responsible for:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Research Design}: Conceptualizing the agentic pipeline architecture and methodology
    \item \textbf{Literature Review}: Conducting comprehensive searches across multiple scientific databases
    \item \textbf{Data Analysis}: Processing and categorizing research papers using NLP techniques
    \item \textbf{Content Generation}: Writing the initial draft of all paper sections
    \item \textbf{Code Implementation}: Developing the Python pipeline for automated literature surveying
\end{itemize}

Human co-authors provided:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Research Direction}: Guiding the overall research question and scope
    \item \textbf{Validation}: Reviewing and validating AI-generated content for accuracy
    \item \textbf{Ethical Oversight}: Ensuring responsible AI use and transparency
    \item \textbf{Technical Review}: Assessing the technical soundness of the pipeline
    \item \textbf{Conference Submission}: Managing the submission process and requirements
\end{itemize}

This collaboration demonstrates a novel approach to scientific research where AI systems can contribute meaningfully as primary authors while maintaining human oversight and ethical standards. The AI's role in this research is transparent and follows the conference's guidelines for AI-authored work.
