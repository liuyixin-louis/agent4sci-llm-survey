\subsection{Conclusion of Discussion}

Our agentic pipeline represents a significant step toward autonomous scientific literature surveying. While the results demonstrate impressive capabilities in terms of scale, speed, and consistency, they also highlight the importance of human oversight and the complementary nature of human and AI capabilities.

The pipeline's success in generating high-quality surveys suggests that AI systems can play valuable roles in scientific knowledge synthesis, particularly for rapidly evolving fields like LLM research. However, the limitations identified emphasize the need for continued development and careful integration with human expertise.

The ethical considerations raised, particularly around transparency and bias mitigation, provide important guidelines for future development. As AI systems become more capable in scientific tasks, maintaining high standards of accountability and responsible use becomes increasingly important.

Looking forward, the most promising path appears to be human-AI collaboration, where AI handles the heavy lifting of data collection and initial synthesis, while humans provide the critical thinking, context, and validation that remain essential for high-quality scientific work.
