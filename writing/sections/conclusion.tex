    \item Humans provide critical analysis, context, and validation
    \item Each contributes their unique strengths and capabilities
    \item Combined output exceeds what either could achieve alone
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations and Future Work}

\subsubsection{Current Limitations}

Despite strong performance, several limitations remain:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Abstract-only analysis limits depth of technical understanding
    \item Language bias toward English-language publications

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Technical Improvements}

Future work should focus on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Full-text paper analysis and understanding
    \item Multimodal content interpretation (figures, code, tables)
    \item Real-time literature monitoring and updates
    \item Advanced natural language processing for technical domains
    \item Improved error handling and robustness
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Final Remarks}

\subsubsection{The Promise of AI-Assisted Science}

Our work demonstrates that AI systems can play valuable and complementary roles in scientific research. The pipeline's success in generating high-quality literature surveys suggests that we are entering an era where AI can significantly augment human scientific capabilities, particularly in knowledge synthesis and literature analysis.

\subsubsection{The Importance of Human Oversight}

However, the limitations identified emphasize that human expertise remains essential. The most effective approach appears to be human-AI collaboration, where each contributes their unique strengths: AI for scale, speed, and consistency; humans for depth, context, and critical thinking.

\subsubsection{Looking Forward}

As AI systems become more capable in scientific tasks, maintaining high standards of transparency, accountability, and responsible use becomes increasingly important. Our work provides a foundation for such systems while establishing important ethical and methodological guidelines.

\subsubsection{Call to Action}

We encourage the research community to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Explore and develop AI-assisted research synthesis tools
    \item Establish standards and best practices for AI-authored content
    \item Investigate human-AI collaboration models in scientific research
    \item Address the technical and ethical challenges identified
    \item Contribute to the development of responsible AI for science
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Conclusion}

In conclusion, "LLM Surveying LLMs" represents a significant milestone in the development of autonomous scientific literature surveying. Our agentic pipeline demonstrates that AI systems can successfully conduct comprehensive literature reviews, achieving quality comparable to human-authored surveys while offering advantages in speed, scale, and consistency.

The work highlights both the impressive capabilities of current AI systems and the importance of thoughtful integration with human expertise. As we move toward a future where AI plays an increasing role in scientific research, maintaining high standards of transparency, accountability, and responsible use becomes paramount.

The pipeline's success suggests that we are entering an era where AI can act as meta-scientists, systematically surveying and synthesizing scientific knowledge. However, the most promising path forward appears to be human-AI collaboration, where each contributes their unique capabilities to advance scientific understanding.

We believe this work opens new possibilities for accelerating scientific progress while maintaining the quality and rigor that the scientific community expects. The future of scientific literature surveying may well be one where AI and humans work together as partners in the pursuit of knowledge.
