\begin{abstract}
Current literature surveys in the rapidly evolving field of Large Language Models (LLMs) are human-authored and struggle to keep pace with the volume of new research. We propose and implement an LLM-agent pipeline that autonomously collects, categorizes, and synthesizes scientific literature. Our system demonstrates the potential for AI to act as meta-scientists, systematically surveying LLM research while maintaining transparency about its AI-generated nature. We evaluate our pipeline on a comprehensive survey of LLM research from 2020-2025, comparing its output against human-authored surveys to assess quality, coverage, and novelty. Our results show that AI-generated surveys can achieve comparable coverage to human efforts while offering unique insights through systematic analysis of large-scale literature corpora.
