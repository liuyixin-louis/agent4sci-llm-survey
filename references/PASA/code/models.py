Ensure that your decision and reasoning are consistent.\n\nSearched Paper:\nTitle: Specialized Language Models with Cheap Inference from Limited Domain Data\nAbstract:  Abstract Large language models have emerged as a versatile tool but are challenging to apply to tasks lacking large inference budgets and large in-domain training sets. This work formalizes these constraints and distinguishes four important variables: the pretraining budget (for training before the target domain is known), the specialization budget (for training after the target domain is known), the inference budget, and the in-domain training set size. Across these settings, we compare different approaches from the machine learning literature. Limited by inference cost, we find better alternatives to the standard practice of training very large vanilla transformer models. In particular, we show that hyper-networks and mixture of experts have better perplexity for large pretraining budgets, while small models trained on importance sampled datasets are attractive for large specialization budgets. \n\nUser Query: Give me papers which shows that using a smaller dataset in large language model pre-training can result in better models than using bigger datasets.\n\n\nOutput format: Decision: True/False\nReason:... \nDecision:"
