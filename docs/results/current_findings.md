# Current Experimental Results

## Status: Early Prototype Testing

**⚠️ Important**: Results shown here are from limited prototype testing, not comprehensive evaluation.

## What We've Actually Tested

### Small-Scale Experiments (5-10 papers)
- **Data Loading**: Successfully loads and indexes papers from sciMCP
- **Search Functionality**: BM25 retrieval working correctly
- **Baseline Generation**: AutoSurvey produces basic survey outlines
- **API Integration**: Claude wrapper functions properly

### Preliminary Observations

1. **Data Pipeline**: Robust - handles 126k+ papers efficiently
2. **Search Quality**: BM25 returns relevant papers for queries
3. **Generation Speed**: Baseline approach takes ~30s for 5 papers
4. **API Reliability**: Claude integration stable with proper error handling

## Known Limitations

### Validation Gaps
- **No Statistical Testing**: Haven't run proper controlled experiments yet
- **Small Sample Sizes**: Only tested with 5-20 papers
- **No Baseline Comparisons**: Haven't compared against published AutoSurvey results
- **Subjective Evaluation**: Quality assessment not yet standardized

### Performance Claims
❌ **Not validated**: Claims like "26.2% improvement" were projected, not measured
❌ **Not validated**: Statistical significance claims (p < 0.001, etc.)
❌ **Not validated**: Convergence behavior (3-4 iterations)

## Next Steps for Validation

### Immediate Testing Needed
1. **Controlled Experiment**: Same papers, multiple approaches, blind evaluation
2. **Sample Size**: Test with 50+ papers per condition
3. **Evaluation Protocol**: Define objective quality metrics
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Proper hypothesis testing

### Research Questions to Address
1. Does global iteration actually improve survey quality?
2. What's the optimal number of iterations?
3. How does performance scale with paper count?
4. What are the computational costs vs. quality tradeoffs?

## Honest Assessment

The project has solid infrastructure and a reasonable research design. The core hypothesis (global > local iteration) is testable and potentially valuable. However, the actual experimental validation work remains to be done properly.

The codebase provides a good foundation for conducting real experiments, but no validated performance improvements have been demonstrated yet.
