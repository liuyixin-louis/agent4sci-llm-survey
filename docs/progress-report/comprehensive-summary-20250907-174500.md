## 🚧 Challenges Faced & Resolutions

### Challenge 1: Citation Count Programmatic Access
- **Issue:** User indicated citation counts not available programmatically
- **Resolution:** Pivoted to temporal patterns (velocity/acceleration)
- **Impact:** Simplified but effective trend discovery

### Challenge 2: Critical Implementation Gap
- **Issue:** Discovered `_improve_citations()` and `_improve_structure()` were stubs
- **Resolution:** Implemented real methods with Claude API integration
- **Impact:** System now genuinely functional

### Challenge 3: Hardcoded Data Path
- **Issue:** `/data/yixin/workspace/sciMCP/` hardcoded
- **Resolution:** Added environment variable `SCIMCP_DATA_PATH`
- **Impact:** System portable across environments

### Challenge 4: Class Naming Inconsistency
- **Issue:** `GlobalIterativeSystem` vs `IterativeSurveySystem`
- **Resolution:** Fixed all references across 7+ files
- **Impact:** Imports now work correctly

### Challenge 5: Test Import Errors
- **Issue:** Tests importing non-existent classes
- **Resolution:** Updated to actual class names
- **Impact:** Test structure validated
