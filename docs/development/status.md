# Development Status

## Current State (September 2025)

This project is in **early research prototype** stage. Here's an honest assessment of what's been implemented vs. what was initially planned.

## Implemented Components

### ‚úÖ Data Infrastructure
- **Paper Loading**: Integration with sciMCP database for loading AI research papers
- **BM25 Indexing**: Search and retrieval of relevant papers by topic
- **Caching**: Basic caching for API calls and data operations

### ‚úÖ Baseline System
- **AutoSurvey Implementation**: Basic version of the AutoSurvey baseline
- **Local Coherence Enhancement (LCE)**: Simple implementation
- **Paper Processing**: Can extract and process paper metadata

### ‚úÖ Evaluation Framework
- **Metrics Definition**: Framework for measuring survey quality
- **Comparison Tools**: Basic tools for comparing different approaches
- **Result Formatting**: JSON output for experimental results

### ‚úÖ API Infrastructure
- **FastAPI Server**: Basic web API for survey generation
- **Claude Integration**: Wrapper for Claude API calls
- **WebSocket Support**: Real-time updates (basic implementation)

## In Development

### üöß Global Iteration System
- **Concept Designed**: Framework for global verification-driven iteration
- **Partial Implementation**: Basic structure exists but needs completion
- **Validation Needed**: No validated performance improvements yet

### üöß Experimental Validation
- **Small Scale Tests**: Some experiments with 5-10 papers
- **Metrics Collection**: Basic data collection infrastructure
- **Statistical Analysis**: Framework exists but limited validation

## Not Yet Implemented

### ‚ùå Performance Claims
- **26.2% Improvement**: This was a projected/simulated result, not validated
- **Production Scale**: No large-scale experiments (100+ papers) completed
- **Statistical Significance**: Claims like "p < 0.001" were not actually computed

### ‚ùå Production Features
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Limited test coverage
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling only
- **Scalability**: Not tested for production workloads
- **Documentation**: Many features documented but not fully implemented

## Technical Debt

1. **Simulation vs Reality**: Many results were simulated/projected rather than measured
2. **Missing Dependencies**: Some imported modules don't exist or are incomplete
3. **API Integration**: Claude CLI integration works but could be more robust
4. **Testing**: Minimal automated testing

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. Complete the global iteration implementation
2. Run actual experiments with real data
3. Validate any performance claims with real measurements
4. Improve error handling and robustness

### Research Validation
1. Design proper experimental protocol
2. Run controlled comparisons with sufficient sample sizes
3. Compute actual statistical metrics
4. Document real results (not projections)

## Lessons Learned

This project demonstrates both the potential and challenges of LLM-assisted research:

- **Rapid Prototyping**: LLMs can quickly create project structure and code
- **Over-Promising**: Easy to generate impressive claims without proper validation
- **Documentation vs Implementation**: Can create extensive docs faster than actual working code
- **Research Process**: Need proper experimental rigor, not just conceptual frameworks

## Honest Assessment

The core idea (global vs local iteration) is sound and worth exploring. The project has good infrastructure and a solid foundation. However, the actual research validation and performance measurement work still needs to be done properly.
